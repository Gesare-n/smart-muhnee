# PesaSmart

## Inspiration
Financial literacy is a major challenge among Kenyan youth and college students. Many struggle with understanding personal finance, investment opportunities, and accessing funding for their business ideas. Through personal experiences—facing challenges in securing funding for a prototype project with my friends and having discussions with classmates—I realized this issue is widespread. PesaSmart aims to address this gap by providing an interactive and engaging platform for financial education.

## What It Does
PesaSmart is a fun and engaging platform designed to help Kenyan youth and college students learn about financial literacy. It includes:
- A **simple and clean UI** for easy navigation.
- **Guidelines and checklists** for building strong business ideas before reaching out to investors.
- An **investment simulator** that allows users to explore different financial options like money market funds, SACCOs, and M-Pesa savings.
- **Gamified quizzes** to test financial knowledge and provide real-world financial insights.
- A **networking section** to connect users with potential investors and mentorship opportunities.
- **User accounts** where individuals can set financial goals and track their progress.

## We  Built It with this 
- **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript for a fast, scalable user experience.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for clean and responsive design.
- **State Management:** Context API for handling authentication and user preferences.
- **Backend:** Flask for API endpoints and database integration.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Implementing **secure authentication** properly.

## What We Learned

- Authentication and state management are key to a seamless user experience.
- We're **great, we're awesome**, and we can build impactful solutions! 

## What's Next
